#Animated Sansa
An arcade-like game about avoiding your past from reaching your future.  
Play it [here](http://dustine.github.io/animated-sansa).

##Premise
Yes, literally. In a way, it's more from reaching your present. There's
time-travel involved, it's what I'm getting at.

You're a poor subatomic phenomenon trapped in what seems an endless rain of energized particles. Colliding with them causes the impossible: a change to history, as you end up back where you started with your past self following the same doomed path ahead of you. Colliding with oneself is ill-advised.

Can you prevent disaster and survive the loop, and while at it, sucking some juicy energy for your own gain?

## Controls
- `WASD` / *Arrow keys* to move
- **OR** *Mouse* to move
   - Can be toggled in-game by clicking on the game view and enabling pointer lock. (Don't worry, it's nothing scary and can be exited right away by pressing `ESC`)
